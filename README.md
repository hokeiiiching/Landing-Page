# Landing-Page
Hello! I'm hokeiiiching, and this is my first ever Landing Page. This Landing Page is a project as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

I will be using this landing page to display everything about myself as a person - my interests, my skills, my career goals, etc.

Most importantly, I am still learning around the ropes of front-end development - and this website is a project that I will use to continously develop my skills, so don't cringe too hard.

Thank you for reading :3

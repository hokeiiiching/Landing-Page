            <p class="quote_text">"Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don't feel like
                working, you're too tired, you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That's the dream. It's not the
                destination, it's the journey. And if you guys can understand that, then what you'll see happen is you won't accomplish your dreams, your dreams
                won't come true; something greater will."

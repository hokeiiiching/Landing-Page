        <p>"Those times when you get up early and you work hard, those times when you stay up late and you work hard, those times when you don't feel like
            working, you're too tired, you don't want to push yourself, but you do it anyway. That is actually the dream. That's the dream. It's not the
            destination, it's the journey. And if you guys can understand that, then what you'll see happen is you won't accomplish your dreams, your dreams
            won't come true; something greater will." - Kobe Bryant, in his 2017 number retirement speech.
